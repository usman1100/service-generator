# Service Generator

Service Generator is a Python script to generate random "as services" that you can later post in a Facebook shitposting group. Coming up with this dumb joke didn't take much effort in the first place but now you can spam these even faster.



## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py <n>
OR
python3 main.py
```
